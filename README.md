question 3. I was unsure if it is supposed to check for $175 in total payment from a customer or see if someone made a payment over $175 or maybe it was $1.75, I did the problem checking for anything over $175.

question 5. Although this is solved;  I was unable to make it "from payment", had to be "from staff" and i'm unsure as to why.

question 7. Even though I have it where amount should only show what is above 6.99 it still shows amounts below it. Im thinking it is showing what im asking but is still including all of the other transaction made by the customer as well.
